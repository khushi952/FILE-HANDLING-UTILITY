## DESCRIPTION 

File handling is a crucial aspect of programming that enables users to store, retrieve, and manipulate data persistently. In Java, file handling is performed using the java.io and java.nio.file packages, which provide classes for reading, writing, appending, and deleting files.
This project, titled "File Handling Utility," is a Java-based console application designed to demonstrate various file operations, such as writing to a file, reading from a file, appending new content, and deleting files. It is implemented in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a widely used integrated development environment (IDE) for Java and other programming languages.

## Key Features of the File Handling Utility
1.Write to a File - The program allows the user to create a file and write text content to it.

2.Read from a File - The user can read the contents of an existing file.

3.Modify (Append) a File - The program provides an option to append additional content to an existing file.

4.Delete a File - Users can delete the file when it is no longer needed.

5.User Interaction via Menu - A simple console-based menu guides users to perform file operations easily.

 ## Platform Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## Explanation of the Code
  ## 1. Writing to a File
  The method writeToFile(String filename, String content) creates a file and writes the specified content into it using BufferedWriter. If the file already exists, it overwrites the previous content.## ## 2. ## 
  
  ## 2.Reading from a File
  The readFromFile(String filename) method reads the content of a file line by line using BufferedReader.
 
  ## 3. Modifying a File (Appending Content)
  The modifyFile(String filename, String newContent) method appends new content to an existing file.
  
  ## 4. Deleting a File
  The deleteFile(String filename) method deletes the file if it exists.

  ## 5. User Menu for File Operations
  The main() method provides an interactive menu, allowing users to choose file operations.

 ## Where is this Task Applicable?
1. Educational Purposes: This program is ideal for beginners learning Java file handling. It demonstrates how to interact with files programmatically.

2. Software Development: Many applications require file handling for data storage and retrieval.Used in log management, configuration handling, and data persistence.

3. Data Processing:Reading, modifying, and storing textual data from external sources.Helpful in processing large text files in automation scripts.

4. Internship & Certification Projects :This project is useful for internship assessments requiring hands-on experience with Java file operations. Can be modified to support real-world applications such as employee record management, note-taking apps, etc.

## Conclusion
The File Handling Utility program is a complete demonstration of file operations in Java. It enables users to create, read, append, and delete text files through a simple menu-driven interface.
The project is implemented in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and showcases the practical use of Java's file handling capabilities.
This program is highly relevant in software development, automation, and data processing applications. It is a valuable skill for anyone working with file management in Java, whether for educational, professional, or internship-related tasks.
